Welcome to the installation of SNOWPACK!
This installer will guide you through installing SNOWPACK, the headers that are required to compile your own programs against SNOWPACK as well as html documentation and code examples. And you can always check SNOWPACK's home page at https://slfsmm.indefero.net/p/snowpack to follow what is going on with SNOWPACK!

In order to run the examples, you will have to copy them to a directory where you have write permissions (like in your home on osX and Linux). You will also have to manually set the following:
		*on osX: set PATH and DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
		*on Linux: set PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you install the package to a non-standard location
		*on Windows: set PATH
How to do this (and much more) is explained in the online documentation at https://slfsmm.indefero.net/p/snowpack/page/Getting-started/ .
